# Python C++ Binding Examples

This workspace contains examples of Python bindings for C++ code using different libraries: [SWIG](https://www.swig.org/exec.html), [cppyy](https://cppyy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html), and [pybind11](https://pybind11.readthedocs.io/en/stable/index.html). [Boost.Python](https://www.boost.org/doc/libs/1_83_0/libs/python/doc/html/tutorial/index.html) was also considered, but not tested.

## Directory Structure

- `cppyy/`: Contains examples using cppyy. The `run_solidMesh.ipynb` is a Jupyter notebook that demonstrates the usage of the bindings for a shared library.
- `pybind11/`: Contains examples using pybind11. The `example.so` file is the compiled C++ extension module.
- `SWIG/`: Contains examples using SWIG. The files `example.cpp` and `example.i` are generated by the user. The `_example.so` file is the compiled C++ extension module. `example_wrap.c`, `example_wrap.cxx`, and `example.py` are also generated by SWIG.

## Running the Examples

Each directory contains a `test.py` script that you can run to test the bindings. For example, to run the SWIG example, you would do:

```sh
cd SWIG
python test.py
```

## More Information

Each directory also contains a `tutorial.md` file with more information about how to install and use each library to create Python bindings for C++ code.
